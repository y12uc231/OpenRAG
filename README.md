# OpenRAG 

Hey there! Welcome to OpenRAG â€” my little corner of the internet where I'm tackling the cool and interesting world of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Models. 

## Note: Work in Progress ðŸš§

Just a heads-up, OpenRAG is a living, breathing project, and very much a work in progress. Things might change, break, or suddenly get a whole lot better!

## Introduction

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the power of language models with external knowledge retrieval to generate more accurate, relevant, and information-rich responses.

## Features

OpenRAG boasts a wide array of features designed to streamline the development process, including:

- **Comprehensive Training Frameworks**: Simplified training pipelines for various RAG models.
- **Modular Fine-Tuning**: Tailor your model to specific domains or tasks with our fine-tuning capabilities.
- **Robust Evaluation Tools**: Assess your models with a suite of evaluation metrics and benchmarks.
- **Community-Driven Enhancements**: Contributions from the community continually refine and expand our toolkit.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before installing OpenRAG, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.6 or higher
- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library by Hugging Face

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/y12uc231/OpenRAG.git
cd OpenRAG
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

To train a RAG model from scratch, use the following command:

```bash
python train.py --data_path <your_dataset_path> --config_path <config_file_path>
```

### Fine-Tuning

Fine-tune your model on a specific task with:

```bash
python fine_tune.py --data_path <your_dataset_path> --model_path <path_to_pretrained_model> --config_path <config_file_path>
```

### Evaluation

Evaluate your model's performance using:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path <path_to_trained_model> --data_path <your_dataset_path> --metrics_path <metrics_config_path>
```
